# TS-Academy-100DaysOfTech
My 100-day learning journey in Python and Data Science at TS Academy
Day 1: Introduction to Data Science
What is Data Science?

Data Science is the discipline of extracting meaningful insights from raw data in order to support informed decision-making.

It combines:

Statistics

Programming

Domain knowledge

Critical thinking

Communication

Data Science is not just about numbers — it is about transforming data into intelligence.

Real-World Applications of Data Science

Data Science powers:

Fraud detection in banks

Disease prediction in healthcare
Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
Sales forecasting in businesses
Traffic navigation systems
Social media algorithms

Every modern industry depends on data-driven decisions.

The Data Science Process

Problem Identification

Data Collection

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis

Modeling (if required)

Insight Generation

Communication of Results

Data without insight is noise.
Insight without communication is useless.

 Why I Am Learning Data Science

As part of the TS Academy 30DaysOfTech challenge, I am building structured thinking, analytical skills, and technical competence in Python and Data Analytics.

My goal is not just to learn coding — but to learn how to solve real-world problems using data.

 Key Insight from Day 1

Data Science is not about programming alone.
It is about using data responsibly to create measurable impact.

 Tools I Will Be Learning

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Data Cleaning
Visualization (Matplotlib)
Analytical Thinking
